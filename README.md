## Introduction

The goal of this project is to classify brain tumors using machine learning techniques. The `predict.py` script utilizes a trained model to predict the presence of a brain tumor based on input images.

## Usage

To use the `predict.py` script, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can run the script with the following command:

```bash
python predict.py --image <path_to_image>
